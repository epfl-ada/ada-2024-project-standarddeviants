**`citations.json`**: This file was generated by retrieving citation data from the [crossref API](https://api.crossref.org/swagger-ui/index.html) using `scripts/citations.py` script, which provides the number of times each Article DOI has been cited. This file contains a structured list of DOIs along with their respective citation counts, offering insights into the influence and significance of each article within its research domain.

**`metadata.csv`**: This file was generated using the function in `scripts/metadata.py`. An example of how to run the code can be found in the exploration folder, within the notebook metadata_example.ipynb. The metadata includes information such as the Curation/DataSource, Article DOI, Binding Entry DOI, as well as the authors and institutions associated with each ligand.

**`prescription_per_drugbank_id.csv`**: This file uses data from [National Drug Code (NDC) Directory](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory), [DrugBank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DrugBank) and [Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-drug-utilization-data/index.html) and creates a link from the BindingDB to prescription data. Code to generate this file can be found in test/prescription.ipynb

**`UniprotID_disases.json`**: This fil is genertated using an Uniprot API call to retrieve disease information. Code to generate this file is provided in results.ipynb.

**`ZINC_references_trials.json`**: The following data was created by running the `src.scripts.clinical_trials` script which contains the following. The above script is indicated to run for 120 hours. As a starting point we ran it for 1 hour which yielded the clinical trial data of the 3000 first most frequent ZINC ID of Ligand.
